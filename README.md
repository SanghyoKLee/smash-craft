# Smash Craft

_Smash Craft_ is a Minecraft Paper plugin that transforms vanilla Minecraft into a PvP brawling mini-game with mechanics inspired by Super Smash Bros.

## Features

- **Triple Jump Mechanics:** Players can jump up to 3 times before hitting the ground.
- **Custom Items with Abilities:** Choose your loadout with unique weapons and abilities.
- **Shielding System:** Players can block attacks to avoid damage and knockback.
- **Multiplayer Arena Battles:** Create your own maps and them loaded from configuration, supporting custom spawns and death zones.
